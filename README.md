# PUSGS-2-Electric-Boogaloo

## Commits and PRs
  * Each feature has it's own branch, derived from the develop branch.
  * **Everything we merge should be merged with develop**.
  * I've created Git Hooks, that will force us to use a prefix for commits:
    * PSG - denotes the project.
    * 123 - number corresponding to a feature.
    E.g. "PSG-123: Some useful commit message"
  * Each PR should consist of a prefix along with the name of the ticket we're working on.
  * PR's can be merged when 2 people review the PR and approve of it.
